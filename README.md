## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This is the one of first "website" project I have attempted, after complete a couple of FreeCodeCamp courses. And even thought it's an easier project, it has allowed for be to review the basics of HTML and CSS. 


### Continued development

In future projects, I will be focusing on learning more about website layout. More specifically, I would like to gain more familiarity with flex box.
